        "Which makes it a bit more 'obvious' that the matrix is a 'list' of vectors. Sort of.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once you get \"higher-rank\" than two, there is no 'special' name for the object, so you just call it a \"tensor\". More correctly, a \"vector\" is a \"special name\" for a rank-1 tensor, and a \"matrix\" is a \"special name\" for a rank-2 tensor. Can you guess what \"scalar\" is a \"special name\" for?\n",

All of these 'advanced' neurons are built on smaller components, which are built using smaller components... which are implemented using linear models (combined with non-linear activations).
